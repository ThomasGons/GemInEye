We've seen them all over the place with various marketing names such as 'Rose' or 'Strawberry' oddly 'Pink Amethyst'. I have to point out that in my mind the term amethyst is indicative of the color purple, so I wouldn't necessarily use it to describe these specimens. This follows the same thoughts that I have to discourage the use of the term 'green amethyst' for prasem quartz. With that said it's not easy to determine an accurate term to describe this material because it's genuinely unique and doesn't quite look like any quartz specimens from any other locality. It's not quite the same color as rose quartz that we're used to seeing from places like Brazil, as it has a slightly orange overtone, so 'pink' might be the best term for them for the time being. These pieces are found as loose geodes and cracked open to expose the beautiful crystals within. This particular piece is lined with excellent, very sharp, highly lustrous, gemmy/translucent, pink colored quartz crystals measuring up to 8 mm filling the inside of the geode in which it formed. Virtually all of the crystals are in good condition, but the periphery is obviously contacted where the piece was broken apart. These are exciting, new and interesting pieces from this remote discovery in Argentina.",

This is one of the better examples I have seen of the material, with sharp crystals of excellent color, individually reaching 6 cm in length. The piece is a complete floater, complete all around. All major crystals are either terminated sharply and only in a few cases, are some minor crystals in the spray a little rough on the tips due to odd growth features, but still complete nonetheless.

The quality of this small cabinet cluster are quite good, and it well-represents the family of great Spanish Pyrites. Jack obtained it from the great old Spanish dealer, Luis Leite (leitite).

It produces little, but what it does give up is awesome for the superb luster and deep rich coloration. The crystals are totally gemmy, lustrous, and have a luscious, medium-green color with the slightest hint of blue (immediately recognizable as Chivor. It is simply a more intense color than emeralds of other mines). The tops of each edge are beveled like gems, and the two terminations are excellent. The weight for this pair is 3.36 ct. Emeralds of this quality are simply far and few between. It is a stunning thumbnail specimen of a gem species.",
