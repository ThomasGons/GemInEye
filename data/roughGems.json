The beautiful, lustrous stepped-growth crystals are set on all sides of the spare marble matrix. The striking, large, sharp, pseudo-octahedral crystal on the bottom is 2.6 cm, very large for the locale. Ex Chet Lemanski Collection. This is a classic, important and exceptionally rich small cabinet ruby specimen with fine color and a large crystal from the locale. It simply looks 'ruby' for color and luster, in a way that many specimens simply cannot do with impact. Cherry-red fluorescence. The fluorescence is simply breathtaking, as a bonus. NOTE: In LED lights, these look more pink-red. In room fluorescents, more classical red. In sunlight, sort of in between. Ruby like this has different color in different warmth of lighting.",

            "description": "This is a very rare cabinet sized example of what some refer to as 'latticework' malachite pseudomorphs after azurite, from Tsumeb. They only came out once in this quality, I am not sure when - and they are today as rare as hen's teeth, especially at size. This is one of the better examples I have seen of the material, with sharp crystals of excellent color, individually reaching 6 cm in length. The piece is a complete floater, complete all around. All major crystals are either terminated sharply and only in a few cases, are some minor crystals in the spray a little rough on the tips due to odd growth features, but still complete nonetheless. This is a superb specimen, a rare style, and a beautiful geometry. Ex Allen Dillwith Collection (he sold off his Tsumeb suite to focus on other suites).",

            "description": "This pyrite cluster is from the world famous sharpest-of-sharp pyrite locality in Spain. These have been the gateway into collecting minerals for so many people over the decades since they started mining here for specimens, including Jack himself. The cubic crystals are well-formed and sharp. The satiny luster is quite good, and the faces have slight undulations that add definite character to the crystals. The largest pyrite crystal is 4.6 cm on edge and the piece is 600 grams in a small volume area, which is quite substantial. The quality of this small cabinet cluster are quite good, and it well-represents the family of great Spanish Pyrites. Jack obtained it from the great old Spanish dealer, Luis Leite (leitite). There are numerous references to Jack and his collection in print, but perhaps a good tour of the collection and its history will help give perspective on just how good, and important, this collection is: " ,

It is starkly geometric, and this is a style known for its shape rather than its color - but unique to this day.
